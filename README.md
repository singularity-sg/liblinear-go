# liblinear-go
This is the Go version of LIBLINEAR which is a port of the Java version located at https://github.com/bwaldvogel/liblinear-java. The liblinear-java project itself is based on an original C++ version.

The project site of the original C++ version is located at http://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/liblinear/

There are cases where the port of the code might be different due to the style of Go language where it makes sense e.g. to have a single switch statement instead of if..elseif..else

# Warning
This porting project is still in a very alpha stage so only use it at your own risk! Contributors are welcome to speed the porting to a point where I'm comfortable releasing it for beta trial.
